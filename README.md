# Object based parametric modelling in Rhino

WE WANT TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE SPECIALIST AND THE USER, REMOVING THE KNOWLEDGE BARRIER THAT REQUIRES TO HARVEST THE PARAMETRIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT GRASSHOPPER PROVIDES BUT IN A SIMPLE RHINO ENVIRONMENT

Rhino Inside Rhino is a plugin for Rhino that empowers users to access powerful, ready-to-use tools directly within their modeling environment. It allows designers to perform complex operations—such as generating Fabrication models, applying facade, or triggering custom geoemtric logic a single click. By simply drawing input elements (like curves or surfaces) and selecting a corresponding function (e.g., “Curtain”), users can instantly apply parametric logic and fine-tune results through intuitive object properties.

This plugin is ideal for architects, designers, and Rhino developers seeking to streamline workflows and enhance interactivity without diving deep into scripting. Developers can easily contribute new tools by dropping pre-configured logic blocks into the repository folder, making it a flexible, community-driven platform for extending Rhino’s capabilities.
